In the context of this paper, an \textit{ideal} content indexing service would enable that for any content, every node would be able to access its closest replica.
Basically, offering such a service would require (i) to have access to the list, namely the \textit{index}, of current replica localizations, (ii) to be aware of the topology to compute which replica is the closest for a given location. We review the existing solutions 

(i) Deploying a centralized server that maintain an index of all replica localizations has been proposed~\cite{fogstore, p2p-alto, p2p-oracle, snamp}. However, this solution suffers from well-known disadvantages inherent to centralized solutions (load balancing, robustness, locality, etc.) that are even magnified in a Fog context.
Distributing this index among nodes in the network circumvent some of these issues, either using coordinate-based overlays~\cite{coin_19, voronet} or Distributed Hash Tables~\cite{squirrel, ipfs, dht-name-resolution, mdht} for example. In the latter, each node stores a part of the index, defined by an interval between hash values. 
Before downloading any object, a node first
hashes the content to obtain the address of the node that stores the replica localizations of this given object. After obtaining from the remote node the list of available replicas, it can select the closest copy to download from. We emphasize that, in this setting, the DHT only stores information about replicas localizations, not the content itself. DHT-based approaches are well-studied and easy to deploy in order to offer such a localization service. 

(ii) Being centralized or distributed, this index should be enhanced with the topology knowledge in order to be able to decide where resides the closest replica . Maintaining a consistent view of an ever changing topology accross a network is ihnerently complicated, especially in asynchronous settings. This is a well-studied problem in the network community and numerous protocols have been proposed. As for the index, this knowledge about the topology can be either centralized[REF] or distributed[REF].


However, solutions that require to contact a remote node (either a server or a DHT node) to request this index usually implies reaching nodes out of the their geographical scope, as already explained.
At first glance, membership protocols as proposed in~\cite{t-man} would appear to provide suitable abstractions to create a scope-related partioning, as proposed in this paper. Yet, such protocols usually rely on gossip mechanims, implying contacts with random nodes that can be very far away in the physical topology. Moreover, membership protocols are designed to generate logical overlays by modifying the neighboring of a given node according to a given metric. 
On the contrary, we do not aim at building any overlay, as we only rely on the physical topology so the neighbors of a given node are not continusously modifed. Lastly, these protocols are usually cycle-based, meaning that they impose a constant load on the network traffic, even when the system state does not change.
Finally, we emphasize that consistency is at the core of our design, as \NAME provides the same guarantees for all nodes.
On the contrary, to avoid flooding, authors in~\cite{opnl} propose to propagate information about cache updates only towards the original replica. This enables for a request to be caught \textit{on-path}, and be redirected to the closest replica. However, the announcement is only performed towards this original replica, that is requests can miss closer replicas that are not on this path, thus decreasing the efficiency of the cache sharing mechanism.

%% \begin{definition}[Dynamic optimal partitioning]
%%   A dynamic optimal partitioning is an optimal partitioning where the
%%   set of sources $S$ does not monotonically increase. We suffix this
%%   set with \underline{t}ime $t$ : $S(t)$.  Process $i$ joins the set
%%   of sources by \underline{a}dding its partition with messages
%%   $\alpha_i^{0}$: $Add(i \not\in S(t)) \implies i \in S(t+1)$; and
%%   leaves the set of sources by \underline{d}eleting its partition with
%%   messages $\delta_i$: $Del(i \in S(t)) \implies i \not\in S(t+1)$.
%% \end{definition}

%% Unfortunately, due to differences in receipt order of messages between
%% processes, stale information may stop prematurely the propagation of
%% relevant messages leading to inconsistent partitioning.
%% \TODO{Figure~\ref{fig:del} shows that.}
% 
% One could solve this issue by using a conflict-free replicated data
% type (CRDT) for set data structures~\cite{shapiro2011crdts}. CRDTs
% require eventual delivery of messages to ensure convergence. All
% processes need to receive, deliver, hence broadcast all
% operations. Some processes may receive operations unnecessary to their
% correct functioning, for these operations did not happen in their
% locality.  One could also solve this issue by removing partitions that
% were not advertised for a defined
% time~\cite{hemmati2015namebased}. \TODO{check distance-vector
%   protocols.} However, relying on physical timeout could lead to
% either premature removals of partitions when they are still operating;
% or slow convergence where processes believe they belong to a partition
% that was removed (\TODO{plot ?}). In addition, since timeouts imply a
% continuous maintenance of partitions, such partitioning protocol
% incurs an overhead even in quiet contexts without dynamic partitions.

%% To further improve scoped flooding in autonomous systems, processes
%% may belong to multiple partitions representing the objects they are
%% aware of. Figure~\ref{fig:ASmotivation} highlights the geo-distributed
%% nature of autonomous systems. Autonomous systems have topological
%% properties~\cite{nur2018geography} that processes can leverage to
%% avoid flooding the whole systems with control information about all
%% partitions. In Figure~\ref{fig:ASmotivation}, Process $e$ creates a
%% partition about a specific object, flooding Paris's AS to notify
%% neighboring processes of the object. However, it does not flood the
%% whole network, for control information stops at Process $b$. It
%% significantly saves bandwidth compared to broadcast since processes
%% below entrypoints of autonomous systems are order of magnitude more
%% numerous. Yet, Processes $c$ and $d$ know whom to ask when they need
%% to return an object they are unaware of. Processes remain efficient in
%% answering requests. \TODO{which is important for end users \REF.}
