%% \begin{definition}[Dynamic optimal partitioning]
%%   A dynamic optimal partitioning is an optimal partitioning where the
%%   set of sources $S$ does not monotonically increase. We suffix this
%%   set with \underline{t}ime $t$ : $S(t)$.  Process $i$ joins the set
%%   of sources by \underline{a}dding its partition with messages
%%   $\alpha_i^{0}$: $Add(i \not\in S(t)) \implies i \in S(t+1)$; and
%%   leaves the set of sources by \underline{d}eleting its partition with
%%   messages $\delta_i$: $Del(i \in S(t)) \implies i \not\in S(t+1)$.
%% \end{definition}

%% Unfortunately, due to differences in receipt order of messages between
%% processes, stale information may stop prematurely the propagation of
%% relevant messages leading to inconsistent partitioning.
%% \TODO{Figure~\ref{fig:del} shows that.}

One could solve this issue by using a conflict-free replicated data
type (CRDT) for set data structures~\cite{shapiro2011crdts}. CRDTs
require eventual delivery of messages to ensure convergence. All
processes need to receive, deliver, hence broadcast all
operations. Some processes may receive operations unnecessary to their
correct functioning, for these operations did not happen in their
locality.  One could also solve this issue by removing partitions that
were not advertised for a defined
time~\cite{hemmati2015namebased}. \TODO{check distance-vector
  protocols.} However, relying on physical timeout could lead to
either premature removals of partitions when they are still operating;
or slow convergence where processes believe they belong to a partition
that was removed (\TODO{plot ?}). In addition, since timeouts imply a
continuous maintenance of partitions, such partitioning protocol
incurs an overhead even in quiet contexts without dynamic partitions.

%%   How to enable \emph{consistent} dynamic optimal partitioning in

%%       objects, processes do not know about all partitions that exist
%%       in the whole distributed system.}

%% \end{figure}

%% To further improve scoped flooding in autonomous systems, processes
%% may belong to multiple partitions representing the objects they are
%% aware of. Figure~\ref{fig:ASmotivation} highlights the geo-distributed
%% nature of autonomous systems. Autonomous systems have topological
%% properties~\cite{nur2018geography} that processes can leverage to
%% avoid flooding the whole systems with control information about all
%% partitions. In Figure~\ref{fig:ASmotivation}, Process $e$ creates a
%% partition about a specific object, flooding Paris's AS to notify
%% neighboring processes of the object. However, it does not flood the
%% whole network, for control information stops at Process $b$. It
%% significantly saves bandwidth compared to broadcast since processes
%% below entrypoints of autonomous systems are order of magnitude more
%% numerous. Yet, Processes $c$ and $d$ know whom to ask when they need
%% to return an object they are unaware of. Processes remain efficient in
%% answering requests. \TODO{which is important for end users \REF.}

%% \begin{definition}[Partitions in asynchronous systems]
%%   Processes may hold multiple partitions \TODO{Use $\mathcal{P}$}
%%   \TODO{TODO} \TODO{or multi-partitioning?}
%% \end{definition}

%% \begin{problem}[\label{prob:inter}Inter-AS consistent partitioning]
%%   How to enable scoped flooding of objects in autonomous systems?
%% \end{problem}

%% Next Section presents our approach that solves these scientific
%% problems by relying on logical control information only.
