\label{sec:background}

Fog infrastructures are distributed systems comprising heterogeneous
machines interconnected by communication links.

\begin{definition}[Fog infrastructure]
  A fog infrastructure is a \underline{g}raph $G(V, E)$ of
  \underline{v}ertices $V$ and bidirectional \underline{e}dges $E \in
  V \times V$. Edges have symmetric \underline{w}eights $w_{ij} =
  w_{ij}$ with $i, j \in V$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Logical partitions]
  A logical \underline{p}artition $P_s$ originated at a
  \underline{s}ource process $s \in V$ is a set of interconnected
  processes that do not belong to another logical partition.
\end{definition}

\begin{algorithm}
  \input{input/algoadd.tex}
  \caption{\label{algo:add}Adding partitions by Process $p$.}
\end{algorithm}

Algorithm~\ref{algo:add} shows the instructions of dynamic
partitioning where the only operation available to processes is the
adding of a partition.  Line~\ref{line:lowestbound} shows the lowest
bound. Line~\ref{line:accumulator} shows the accumulator.

\TODO{Removing partition is more difficult.}
