\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

As future work, we plan on enhancing the
\underline{I}nter\underline{P}lanetary \underline{F}ile
\underline{S}ystem (IPFS)~\cite{henningsen2020mapping} with dynamic
logical partitioning capabilities in order to improve its caching
policy of popular contents at marginal cost.

\noindent We also plan on further improving scoped broadcast between
multiple autonomous systems. Indeed, processes could leverage the
hierarchical properties of such topology~\cite{nur2018geography} to
avoid flooding the whole systems with control information about all
partitions.
