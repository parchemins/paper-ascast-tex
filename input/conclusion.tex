\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed a general purpose definition of scoped
broadcast, and an extension to automatically adapt the scope of scoped
broadcast in contexts where each process can decide whether or not it
decide to be a source. We proposed an implementation called \NAME.

As future work, we plan on enhancing the
\underline{I}nter\underline{P}lanetary \underline{F}ile
\underline{S}ystem (IPFS)~\cite{henningsen2020mapping} with dynamic
logical partitioning capabilities in order to improve its caching
policy of popular contents at marginal cost.

\noindent We also plan on further improving scoped broadcast between
multiple autonomous systems. Indeed, processes could leverage the
hierarchical properties of such topology~\cite{nur2018geography} to
avoid flooding the whole systems with control information about all
partitions.
