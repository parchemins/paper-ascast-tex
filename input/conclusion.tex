How to design distributed system in order to deal with consistency,
availability and partitioning is something our community has been
working on for a long time.  Though important achievements have been
with now building blocks have been proposed to help developers deal
with these concerns, the advent of the Edge and IoT era raises a new
complexity: how can we lock down the trafic only where it is
essential!

In this paper, we proposed a general purpose definition of scoped
broadcast, and an extension to automatically adapt the scope of scoped
broadcast in contexts where each process can decide whether or not it
decide to be a source. We proposed an implementation called \NAME.

As future work, we plan on enhancing the
\underline{I}nter\underline{P}lanetary \underline{F}ile
\underline{S}ystem (IPFS)~\cite{henningsen2020mapping} with dynamic
logical partitioning capabilities in order to improve its caching
policy of popular contents at marginal cost.

%% \noindent We propose an implementation that further decreases
%% generated traffic and improves on
%% anonymity~\cite{whitaker2002forwarding}.  \NAME makes extensive use of
%% paths to enable deleting messages without incrementing local
%% counters. Messages carry their respective path and processes detect
%% when such messages have been looping when they carry their identity
%% (see Lines~\ref{line:notloopingA} and \ref{line:notloopingB} of
%% Algorithm~\ref{algo:adddelundo}). Since membership is all that
%% matters, we propose to trade vectors of identities for Bloom
%% filters~\cite{almeida2007scalable}. Processes know with high
%% probability if they already received and forwarded each message
%% without knowing the identity of all processes that received it.  False
%% positive probability only incurs premature stopping of broadcast
%% messages and does not invalidate the delete of specific
%% messages. \TODO{Rework.}

\noindent We also plan on further improving scoped broadcast between
multiple autonomous systems. Indeed, processes could leverage the
hierarchical properties of such topology~\cite{nur2018geography} to
avoid flooding the whole systems with control information about all
partitions.


% TODO : Use cases
While we use the distance to the closest copy in this paper, It is
notewothy that other scopes can be envisioned according to the
use-cases.  For instance, the location of a city in order to broadcast
message to all nodes in the city.  This requires nodes to store and
maintain their city location in their local state. Nodes stop
delivering and forwarding their received messages when they come from
a different city. Such a predicate can be complexified in order to
broadcast messages to all nodes in the city plus neighboring
cities. This requires nodes to overload forwarded messages the first
time they reach another city. The predicate checks if messages already
reached two distinct cities before delivery.  The predicate can even
be piggypack within the message and so be different for each
message.\TODO{Complete the use-cases}
