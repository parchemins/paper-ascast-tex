  Fog infrastructures allows content providers to better distribute
  data over autonomous systems, hence improving on quality of user
  experience by reducing latency. However, locating the closest data
  sources can prove challenging in dynamic networks with dynamic
  sources. Locating sources may effectively take more time than
  actually downloading contents. \TODO{Related work ?} In this paper,
  we introduce \NAME, a reactive protocol for dynamic logical
  partitioning in dynamic networks. \TODO{source automatically create
    partitions.} \NAME uses epidemic dissemination (\TODO{scoped
    flooding}). \TODO{costs of operations.} When the system becomes
  quiescent, every process eventually converges to its closest
  partition, then \NAME incurs no overhead. \TODO{Proof, simulation,
    testbed?}
