We also propose an implementation that further decreases generated
traffic and improves on anonymity~\cite{whitaker2002forwarding}.
\NAME makes extensive use of paths to enable deleting messages without
incrementing local counters. Messages carry their respective path and
processes detect when such messages have been looping when they carry
their identity (see Lines~\ref{line:notloopingA} and
\ref{line:notloopingB} of Algorithm~\ref{algo:adddelundo}). Since
membership is all that matters, we propose to trade vectors of
identities for Bloom filters~\cite{almeida2007scalable}. Processes
know with high probability if they already received and forwarded each
message without knowing the identity of all processes that received
it.  False positive probability only incurs premature stopping of
broadcast messages and does not invalidate the delete of specific
messages.
