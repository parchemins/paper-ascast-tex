\label{sec:proposal}

A reactive logical partitioning the cost of which actually depends on
its usage.

The main idea is maintaining graphs of partitions using local
knowledge only and use graphs as often as possible: it improves
resilience to crashes, convergence speed etc. Unfortunately,
maintaining graphs of partitions in dynamic networks may require the
use of broadcast tree. The removal of a communication channel between
2 processes may remove an advantageous path from processes downstream
to the source of the partition they belong to.


\subsection{Complexity}
\label{subsec:complexity}

We focus on average-case and worst-case complexity. We divide our
analysis into space, time, and communication complexity.

\textbf{The communication complexity} concerns the size and number of
messages required to reach optimal partitioning. In the average-case,
a process $i$ chosen uniformly at random among all processes creates a
logical partition. Its messages $\alpha_i$ propagate through the
network until reaching processes that belong to another partition
closer to them. This splits partitions in half in average. Overall,
the $a^{th}$ new partition comprises
\smash{$\mathcal{O}(\frac{|V|}{2^{\lfloor \log_2 a \rfloor}})$}
processes. This decreases every new partition until reaching $0$
processes per new partition: even the chosen process already belongs
to its optimal partition. The average number of messages per process
is \smash{$\mathcal{O}(\frac{\overline{|O|}}{2^{\lfloor \log_2 a
      \rfloor}})$}. \TODO{Multiple receipt and multiple delivery imply
  more messages (receipt bounded by $|O|$ as well).} Deleting the
$a^{th}$ partition generates the exact same number of messages than
the $a^{th}$ partition creation. \TODO{But what about echos?} In the
worst-case, every new partition includes all but one process belonging
to the previous partition. The total number of messages after the
$a^{th}$ new partition is $\mathcal{O}(\overline{|O|}\cdot a^2)$. As
for the average-case, the number of messages for the partition
deletion is identical to the number of messages of the corresponding
partition creation.
